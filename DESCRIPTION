Description: Pqsfinder detects
        DNA and RNA sequence patterns that are likely to fold into an
        intramolecular G-quadruplex (G4). Unlike many other approaches,
        pqsfinder is able to detect G4s
        folded from imperfect G-runs containing bulges or mismatches
        or G4s having long loops. Pqsfinder also assigns an integer score
        to each hit that was fitted on G4 sequencing data and corresponds
        to expected stability of the folded G4.
