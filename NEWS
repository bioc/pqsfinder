CHANGES IN VERSION 1.3.3
------------------------

NEW FEATURES:

    o Score distribution is now reported. For each sequence position
      you get maximal score of PQS that was found overlapping
      the position. For details, see scoreDistribution function.
    o Novel scoring parameter was introduced. Now it is possible
      to specify exponent of loop length mean in the scoring equation
      to express non-linear dependency of the PQS propensity to the
      loop lengths.

BUG FIXES

    o Fixed unintentional cast of loop length mean factor and loop
      standard deviation factors from float to integer.
      

CHANGES IN VERSION 1.2.1
------------------------

BUG FIXES

    o Fixed bug responsible for a segmentation fault. Great credit
      belongs to Diego Andino for sending a bug report.

CHANGES IN VERSION 1.0.0
------------------------

    o Novel algorithm for identification of potential intramolecular
      G-quadruplex (G4) patterns in DNA sequence.
    o Supports multiple defects in G-runs like bulges or mismatches.
    o Provides the most accurate results currently available.
    o Highly customizable to detect even novel G4 types that might be
      discovered in the future.
